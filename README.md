# PixelGame

This is a small web-app for an image-guessing game. You can upload a series of images by drag&drop and then generate a pixelized version of each image that progressively gets 'unpixelized'. 

## Setup

This is built using [Angular](https://angular.io/), so make sure you have a recent Angular version installed. Call `npm install` from the root folder, then `ng serve` to run locally. 

## Usage

Drag&drop one or more image files into the application. Currently, only JPG and PNG files on your local machine are supported. Once loaded, you can press space to start the image-guessing game. Press space again to show the actual image without pixelization. Press space once again to proceed to the next image.
